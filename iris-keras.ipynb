    "Well in mathematics, tensors are geometric objects that describe linear relations between geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensors. TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. If you would like to know more about TensorFlow, I'd start [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n",

For this reason, the first layer in a Sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape. \n",

    "\n",
    "Then We'll add another layer with 3 nodes, and a final layer using Softmax activation.
